# Contributing

## How to contribute

* File issues.
* Edit/write documentation.
* Submit pull requests.
* Test in different environments.
* Raise awareness.

## Summary of tools

Following tools are getting used:

* `TypeScript` as primary language - https://www.typescriptlang.org/
* `compodoc` for API documentation - https://compodoc.app/
* `Jasmine` for test cases - https://jasmine.github.io/
* `Karma` for running test cases in browsers - http://karma-runner.github.io/
* `webpack` for build - https://webpack.js.org/
* `nodejs` during development - https://nodejs.org/
* `npm` for dependency management, packaging and distribution - https://www.npmjs.com/
* `git` for version control - https://git-scm.com/

## Initial setup

Instructions on setting up development environment:

* Install `node` and `npm` - https://nodejs.org/
* Checkout code from GitHub - you may fork the code first into your GitHub account.
* Use `npm i` to install dependencies:
    ```bash
    $ npm i
    ```

## Setup a Stomp broker

* A Stomp broker is used for running the tests. I have been using RabbitMQ.
* Edit `spec/helpers/stomp.service.factory.ts` as per
  your setup. Defaults should work for as RabbitMQ default setup on localhost.
* Please note that in RabbitMQ you will need to enable Stomp and WebStomp plugins.
* By default RabbitMQ WebStomp will treat messages a text, you will need to tell
  it is use binary frames:
    ```bash
    $ echo 'web_stomp.ws_frame = binary' >> /etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.conf
    ```
* A RabbitMQ Dockerfile is provided with necessary plugins and configuration. To use it, run:
    ```bash
    $ docker build -t myrabbitmq rabbitmq/ # Needed only once
    $ docker run -d -p 15674:15674 myrabbitmq # to start the broker
    ```

## Building and testing

Key npm tasks:

```text
clean - Remove generated built artifacts
build-tsc - Internally used by `npm run build`
build-webpack - Internally used by `npm run build`
build - Build three variants - ES5, ES6, and UMD
doc - Generate docs
doc-serve - Generate docs and watch for changes
karma - Rune test in browsers
```

### Basic development workflow

1. Checkout a new branch.
1. Make code changes (src/specs)
1. Build:
    ```bash
    $ npm run build
    ```
1. Run tests:
    - To run tests using nodejs:
        ```bash
        $ npm run test
        ```
    - To run tests using Chrome:
        ```bash
        $ npm run karma
        ```
    - _**Caution:** As both browser and nodejs use same set of test cases and same queue
      names. So, running both together may cause unexpected failures._
1. Please follow GitHub guidelines. Raise an issue if you are unclear.
